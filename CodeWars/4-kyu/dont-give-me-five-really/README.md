Really!</a></h2><h3>4 kyu</h3><p>This kata is the performance version of <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5813d19765d81c592200001a" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Don't give me five</a> by <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/user5036852" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">user5036852</a>. </p><p>Your mission, should you accept it, is to return the count of all integers in a given range which <em>do not</em> contain the digit 5 (in base 10 representation).<br>You are given the start and the end of the integer range. The start and the end are both inclusive.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><pre><code>1,9 -&gt; 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -&gt; return 84,17 -&gt; 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -&gt; return 12</code></pre><p>The result may contain fives. ;-)<br>The start will always be smaller than the end. Both numbers can be also negative.</p><p>The regions can be very large and there will be a large number of test cases. So brute force solutions will certainly time out!</p><p>Good luck, warrior!</p>
